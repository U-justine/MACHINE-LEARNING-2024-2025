Linear regression is a method for determining the best linear relationship between two variables X and Y. If
variables X and Y are uncorrelated, it is pointless embarking upon linear regression. However, if a reasonable
degree of correlation exists between X and Y then linear regression may be a useful means to describe the
relationship between the two variables. The usual approach is to use the least-squares method, which
minimizes the squared difference between the actual data points and a straight line. Let [xi,yi], i = 1,2,3,....,N be
the N pairs of data values of the variables X and Y. The straight-line relating X and Y is y = mx + c,
where m and c are the gradient and constant values (to be determined) defining the straight line. Thus, y(xi) -
yi is the difference between the line and data point i . Taking all the data points, we seek values
of m and c that minimize the squared difference SD.
